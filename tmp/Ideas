so mainly i'm thinking...

maybe a floaty movment game

where you platform around and pick up different tablets that have runes on them
akin to neon white
and each of these runes have a cool mobility thing and a cool movement mechanic

You're around a planet as a spaceship
spaceships are shooting at you, they all have these unique tablets with runes on them
when you kill a ship they drop a rune, you can use these runes in battle

There is a rune that gives you a gravitational pull
