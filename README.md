## Build process (with CMake)

You will need:
- GCC
- CMake
- Make
- [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg),
you will need to set the `VCPKG_ROOT` environment variable to the location of your vcpkg install

To build for linux, run this command:
```bash
cmake --workflow --preset linux
```
This will create a linux executable in `build/linux/out`

---
To build for web, you will also need [emscripten](https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html).
Run this command:
```bash
cmake --workflow --preset web
```
This will create the output in `build/web/out`

You can test the web build locally by running:
```bash
python -m http.server -d build/web/out/
```
And going to `localhost:8000`

---
To build for windows (from a linux host), you will also need mingw.
Run this command:
```bash
cmake --workflow --preset mingw
```
This will create a windows executable in `build/mingw/out`
